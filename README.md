# model-selection-war

This is a problem from homework 3 of the STAT 435 course at UW (machine learning). It required me to use feature selection using subset selection, ridge regression, and the LASSO on a dataset of my choice with $p \geq$ 30 predictors. I used pitching and fielding stats from the Lahman Baseball Database as well as pitching rWAR from Baseball-Reference.com (I also used BIP from this .csv file, which I needed to get to 30 predictors) in order to identify different selections of best predictors using the aforementioned methods of model selection. The spec of the problem is included in this repo.
